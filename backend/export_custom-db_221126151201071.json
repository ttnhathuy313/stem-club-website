				"description": "\nThe Covid-19 outbreak last year had frozen all kinds of in-person team activities within the Fulbright community. Therefore, when students were finally welcomed back to the campus, part of them, especially first-year students, barely had a taste of how fun these large gathering events could be. To revive this good old fun and enhance intellectual curiosity, Fulbright STEM Club aspired to host Trivia Night - an intellectual exchange where knowledge and fun were widespread.  \n\n\n## THE WHAT  \n\nTrivia Night is a gameshow where teams participate in a race to test their understanding in a broad range of knowledge. Each team can include from 3 to 5 people, including the Faculty, the Staff, and Undergraduate students within the Fulbright community. There are 20 questions, either multiple-choice or short-answered, in a game. For each question, the team needs to make a bet on how many points they want to gain. The betting condition varies on questions; therefore, participants need to make a wise choice or else they might lose points dramatically. The winning team will be the one that sticks to the final question with the highest overall points.  \n\n![0f027fcc-6396-421a-bb42-09f8890845ff.jpeg](https://res.cloudinary.com/dq5xtekcp/image/upload/v1657504640/0f027fcc_6396_421a_bb42_09f8890845ff_6918e29025.jpg)\n\n## THE HIGHLIGHTS \n\n### Participants  \n\nTrivia Night have been hosted in 2021, before the Covid-19 outbreak in Ho Chi Minh city and this year on April 16th, 2022, from 6:15 - 8:00 PM. It was the most crowded public event with almost 150 participants teamed up to 14 groups. Together all of them made it to the end and worked hard to solve all the tricky questions within a very short time (30s to 2 minutes).  \n![95ad93bd-e40e-4bfb-9a97-47b4c3c3d0b5.jpeg](https://res.cloudinary.com/dq5xtekcp/image/upload/v1657503829/95ad93bd_e40e_4bfb_9a97_47b4c3c3d0b5_0cbde26d6b.jpg)\n\n\n### Question Set  \n\nQuestions were designed by a group of students from Fulbright Stem Club. To come up with a question bank, they had to spend one month to do intensive research in a wide range of disciplines: math, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, politics, philosophy. The requirements were all the questions are not just fact-based but have to be fun and logical reasoning. In case you missed the game or want to look back into it, here are some of the most favorite questions voted by participants, try answer them yourself but only within 30s-2 minutes! _(Answers at the end of the article) \n_\n_- Every day, according to oddly statistic, human digest 2.267kg of food, averagely 2000 calories a day for woman and 2500 calories per day for man. So, how much do human poop a day on average?  \n\n- In a group of students, 10 students like Calculus and 15 students like Linear Algebra. Alongside, 7 students like both subjects and 17 students like neither. How many students are there in the group?  \n\n- We have leap year in Gregorian calendar, it usually happens every four years. The phenomenon indicates that a year has 365 days and some spare hours. How much is that spared time? _(Please input an integer) \n_\n- We went out with friends at night, we looked so fancy and fabulous, so we wanted to take a picture by camera with flash. But after taking the picture, we look like zombies or fabulous vampires (or fabulous zombies) because our eyes turn red. What causes this condition?  \n\nA. The camera cannot capture black/brown color from our beautiful eyes, so the nearest color is red.  \n\nB. We are truly sexy vampires and sexy zombies.  \n\nC. It is the blood in our eyes. _\n\n Hmm, tricky right? To produce such an interesting quiz like this was a big challenge but our content team with smart brains, had successfully fulfilled the intellectual mission. We would like to give them big applause!  \n \n### Building The Grading App  \n\nNow you might wonder how the organizers could handle the point evaluation for 14 teams given the fluctuation of points due to making bets? Of course, we could never have done this properly without our genius programmers: Ngoc Long from Google Developer club, Nhat Khoi and Nhat Huy from Fulbright Stem Club. It was days and nights of fixing bugs and testing to perfect the grading systems. We asked Nhat Khoi about their app building process, here is what he shared: _‘’Very intensive! I feel like I was working in a startup at the Sillicon Valley, running many sprints overnight to deliver the product for hundred of users! ALong that process, our team has to work seamlessly together from product design to frontend to backend development. Our lesson after this project are first, having at least an experienced teammate in building real-life applications. Second, have a short feedback loop. Third, prepare for any incidents that might happen in the deployed environment.’ \n\n![6ca3adff-3f8c-43d2-9fed-0e1420c39736.jpeg](https://res.cloudinary.com/dq5xtekcp/image/upload/v1657504036/6ca3adff_3f8c_43d2_9fed_0e1420c39736_4309000965.jpg)\n\n\n### The Teams  \n\nAll the teams have made an outstanding performance. Fulbright people had shown how talented and well-rounded they are! However, a game only has a (legit) winner, we congratulated the team ‘’dzzễ’'’ for the first place, ‘’The Winning Team’’, and ‘’Sáng nhất đêm nay’’ for the two runners-up. BIG APPLAUSE!  \n\n![DSCF1575.JPG](https://res.cloudinary.com/dq5xtekcp/image/upload/v1657504105/DSCF_1575_cd7b9f6479.jpg)\n\n![DSCF1590.JPG](https://res.cloudinary.com/dq5xtekcp/image/upload/v1657504139/DSCF_1590_5827af30cb.jpg)\n\n![DSCF1543.JPG](https://res.cloudinary.com/dq5xtekcp/image/upload/v1657504165/DSCF_1543_86d0e09d99.jpg)\n\n\n### The Fun  \n\nThe purpose of the game is not to seek the ultimate winners, but to promote learning-spirit and consolidate the bonds within our Fulbright community. When joining the game, participants had a chance to intellectually collaborate with other friends and experience the wholesome fun of making a good bet and a bad bet. Our participants, Quynh and Phuoc Anh, had some thoughts: _’I appreciated the diversity in the vendors at the expo, the topics and variety of sessions. I think the last thing I appreciated outside of the healthy food options would be Keynote speakers and the topics they covered and deliver.’’  \n_\n\n![DSCF1397.JPG](https://res.cloudinary.com/dq5xtekcp/image/upload/v1657504240/DSCF_1397_9a6710a42f.jpg)\n\n\n## The Final Thought  \n\nWe believe that only by working together in a stress-free environment can we promote an engaging and inclusive academic environment. Organizing Trivia Night is part of our efforts on making STEM a more fascinating discipline and that STEM is not just geeky! We are geeky, yet we have fun, and we design the fun!  \n\nStay tuned for the next Trivia Night!  \n\n  ",

The Fellowship is an **8-week-long** forum **to engage key methodological issues in historical and contemporary philosophy and ethics in science and technology.** We believe this could be a pivotal point for STEM Club and Philosophy Society to create a safe and open dialogue on pressing social issues that converge upon the intersection of science, technology, ethics, and philosophy at our school.\n\nThe Philosophy of Science Fellowship is an 8-week-long forum to engage key methodological issues in historical and contemporary philosophy and ethics in science and technology. STEM Club believes this Fellowship marks a pivotal point for STEM Club to create a safe and open dialogue on pressing social issues that converge upon the intersection of science, technology, ethics, and philosophy.\n\n\n#### Executive Plan\n\nSince the beginning of the Spring semester, members of the Fellowship have met and discussed the reading list for the 8 gatherings. Though not required, it is highly recommended that members finish the reading materials before coming to the Fellowship’s weekly gatherings. Văn Khoa Luận Đàn will meet to discuss how to think about science philosophically, how the philosophy of science fits within the broader discipline of science and technology, and how to make use of these discourses in related disciplines such as philosophy, anthropology, and science technology studies. After the project, all members will produce short personal reflections about the discussed content which can be shared with the broader community.\n\nDuring the first discussion, we questioned the basics of philosophy and science. There, we asked: What is science? What is philosophy? How is it different to see the world from the vantage of the philosophy of science versus the science of philosophy’s viewpoint? Or is there any difference at all? There, we read Feng Youlan’s question on the history of Chinese philosophy and Wesley Salmon’s inquiry onto the scientific explanation. Additionally, we also watched Nguyen Vinh Son’s The Moon at the Bottom of the Well (Trang Noi Day Gieng) to see the connection between reality and the metaphysics. Topics to be discussed in the upcoming weeks include scientific realism, constructive empiricism, and objectivity. The Fellowship is currently in progress with weekly discussions being held in the hybrid set-up to accommodate all members’ personal needs.\n",

				"description": "#### Introduction\n\n**The Keen Podcast** is a student-led project belongs to STEM Club in Fulbright University Vietnam, with the vision of becoming a high quality and reliable audible channel that withhold the conversations and discussion among science communities in Vietnam. The channel is an audio platform to share ideas and engage deep discussion related to both theoretical and applied science among science communities in Vietnam.\n\nWe are motivated to create educational materials for young Vietnamese learners' inspiration. Descriptively, the channel will approach different aspects of a discipline, including academic perspectives, philosophical approaches to academia and career, perspectives of industry. As keen learners, we hope to inspire young learners to become lifelong learners through our interviews with guest speakers.\n\nYou can also visit us on Spotify via [this link](https://open.spotify.com/show/1S0hnURWTEnayC2mgmcyht?si=315f0fcd4b7542c0).\n\n\n#### Executive Plan\n\n##### Members of the project\n\n- Project leader: Chau Le\n- Project members: Phuc Le, Nguyen Tran, Huy Vu, Quynh-Anh Nguyen, Que (Laura) Phan, and Lan Phuc.\n\nWe have 3 main roles in the project as sound technicians, hosts, and editors. Each member can play multiple roles. \n\n\n##### Plan for the podcast\n\n- In the next 2 months, we will focus on developing our academia interviews channel, where we reimagine STEM education from multiple STEM fields.\n- In 2022 summer, we will focus on learning our listeners’ behaviors and needs to introduce more series in the up-coming academic year.\n\n##### Activities of STEM Podcast\n\n- We have weekly meetings on every Sunday both online and offline (it is the hybrid time!)\n- We usually gather for recording with the faculty and get really tired afterward ༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ\n- We quite love to be organized and productive but cannot avoid (づ￣ ³￣)づ laziness!!!\n- In the end, the perk of being podcasters is that we can learn so many from the guests’ interviews. After all, we are the one who listen (▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿) to the content most closely.\n",
